# Earthquakes App

This is a sample application intentionally built to be imperfect.

# TODOs
## Details screen
###Implement a new screen that will display:
- title
- earthquake's location on the map
- magnitude
- date
- ...
### Implement filter by continent
- use `continent` query parm, for example https://barfooz.net/earthquakes?continent=europe


## Available endpoints:
* https://barfooz.net/earthquakes
* https://barfooz.net/earthquakes/<id>
* https://barfooz.net/earthquakes?continent=europe
